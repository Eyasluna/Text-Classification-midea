# Text_Classification_midea
Parts of NLP project at midea.
Implement both support vector machine and fastText by Facebook to build Chinese text classifier. 
The bayes_classifier.py used the Naive Bayes Classifier which supposes all features has indepandent probability. 
Both SVM and bayes implement Jieba as the Chinese tokenizer since the scikit-learn doesn't support Chinese.
